# Prosger

This project was created to demonstrate how an processor works.
It takes webms as input and play them to simulate a process going on. While a video is playing a queue of webms is created, as soon as one is done the next one starts.
It was requested in the college to show the phases of an processor.

In this project I choose to use the FIFO pattern.

There are still things to be implemented in this project:

*Controler
  Control de processor. Starting, pausing, stoping, clearing the lists.
*Input ghost processes
  Create a process with a description and the time it has to last.
*Input images
  Use images as processes with their time seted by it size.
*Input scripts
  Use scripts to simulate a process with input and everything else.

Resuming, there is a lot of things that are not done, BUT it works.
